# DOCUMENTATION
## akum7246-tracker

## Purpose:
>This repo is dedicated to a web application that tracks the users' runs and allows them to maintain a history of their running data to track their progress.

## Initial Config
>Run "NPM install" in the terminal to install EXPRESS.
>
>Run the local server by using the prompt "npm run start" or "node server.js" in the terminal.


## Functionality/Features
>Add/store new and existing runs (In visual list as well as web browser).
>
>See a visual list of previously added runs along with all the relevant run data.
>
>Automatically calculates and displays your average pace based on distance and duration inputs.
>
>Responsive UI for both mobile and desktop devices.
>
>Delete selected run from visual list as well as the browser storage.
>
>Interactivite and dynamic UI implemented through hover state to access additional information
(Tool tip)
>
>Active field represented through blue outline of the input field, 
>
>drop shadow and hover states implemented on all buttons included in the web app in order to convey clickability of these elements.


## Getting Started
>Enter your relevant run information and click "Add Your Run" to store it in the visual list and browser storage.
>
>To utilize the tooltip present next to the "Perceived Exertion" label, kindly disable your adBlocker
as this feature tends to glitch and not work as intended when an adBlocker is enabled.
>
>### Preferred Screen Sizes/Resolution
>Desktop : 1920 x 1080 px
>
>Mobile : 375 x 812 px (Apple iPhone X)

## General Improvements
>Improved input field by using a contrasting colors in order to improve the visibility of the fields.
>
>Implemented a discard activity button instead of a simplistic form reset button. This button is made more obvious through a contrasting color and bigger dimensions. This button is triggered once the user clicks the "add activity" button to create a new entry. Clicking this button resets the form and also hides the input form simultaneously.



## Lessons Learnt
>**Utilizing Reusable CSS Styles/Properties** : I learnt that having a good foundation of CSS knowledge is extremely important for web app development. Following CSS best practices like reusable styles, media queries, flexible units (eg. percentages, viewport units, etc) would have allowed me to create more intuitive and holistic design; it would also have greatly simplified my development process.
>
>**Importance of Semantic HTML Elements** : Another major lesson that I learnt was the importance of using semantic HTML elements. Failing to do so required me to create a unique ID for almost every HTML element in-order to style it in CSS. Therefore, in hindsight, I would look more into building semantically correct code in-order to avoid duplication of the same pieces of code.
>
>**Utilizing StackOverflow** : Using StackOverflow for troubleshooting bugs was extremely helpful. I discovered it through this assignment and will probably continue using it as it is very useful.
>
> **Utilizing Git Version Control** : Using Git for version control was helpful for managing my code, and keep track of changes. This, was very useful as it helped keep a backup of all versions of my code and refer back to it on demand.

## Recommendations for Future Improvements
>**Implement Auto-generated Image** : Include an automatically selected image that is generated based on the type of run selected by the user. This image would be displayed in the visual list and could be accesed using a modal popup. Overall, including this autogenerated image would make the UI more visually appealing to suers and also provide an enhanced user-experience; as visual information is easier/faster to process as compared to normal text.
>
>**Implementing Modal Popups** : Since I was unable to implement an automatically selected image based on drop down selection for each run type; I could not implement a modal popup as my original mockup included this autoselected in the popup. I think that implementing this feature would make the UI more visually appealing and make the appplication more enticing to users.
>
>**Improved Performance Analytics** : Although the current application is able to calculate the pace of the users' run based on user input, the app would be more intuitive and appealing if it provided more detailed insights into the users' run such as calories burnt, elevation, etc. This would help users better track and mantain their running performance overtime. 
>
>**Dynamically Interactive Tooltip** : I was unable to implement this feature due to a recurring bug that I could not find the cause of. Implementing a dynamic tooltip that switches its interactivity between hover display and click display ;based on desktop and mobile screen sizes respectively, would be a great feature that would make the tooltip more inclusive to mobile users aswell.
